# üéì Discite Omnes (Semester Project ‚Äì In Development)

**Discite Omnes** (Latin for "Learn, Everyone") is a native Android app (work in progress) designed as a platform for collaborative learning. The goal is to enable students to create study groups, manage tasks, and track their learning progress together.

This project is currently under development as part of a semester assignment and demonstrates the practical application of Android development with Java and a client-server architecture.
